<!--
**Double-check**

* Is this *really* a bug?
  - If the behavior is documented, but you disagree with it, please do file an issue, but as a "Design consideration," not a "Bug report."
  - If you don't understand why something behaves the way it does, consider asking on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VTgsTGS9b7).
* Is the problem not in some third-party library, not in [Kryptokrona](https://github.com/kryptokrona/issues)?
* Maybe you're using some ancient version, and the problem doesn't happen with the latest releases of the compiler and the library?
